Techdegree Project 1

I am attempting an Exceeds Expectations mark.

The project has been checked in the following browsers
- Chrome
- firefox
- IE
- Edge

I added a fix in for the cards as they did not center when at a certain viewport size (<720px)

replaced cards with sections 
moved main nav into the header
added contact page no form
added new extra media query
added images in to the sections
created a new "card" element to house contact info
added z-index to nav to prevent the profile picture clipping through on transition
