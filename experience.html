        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>I am majority self taught and I am hungry for work. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Bapple Creative</h3>
                <p><strong>Decemeber 2018 - Present</strong><em>Remote Developer</em></p>
                <p>While working for Bapple I have been responsible for projects ranging form single page landing pages to more complex projects built in Magento. I met tight deadlines and solved problems the company never knew existed all while tackling the communication barrier.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Salt Shaker Studio</h3>
                <p><strong>Decemeber 2018 - Present</strong><em>Creative Director</em></p>
                <p>Running you own studio is difficult and time consuming I have my own production pipeline, using tradtional methods.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
      </div> 

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>While being a father is difficult and very time consuming I do have interests of my own that are not my childrens.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reading Poetry, I don't need to remember the poet to remember the impact</li>
          <li>Complex and seemingly difficult problems: I may never solve a millenium problem but they are interesting enought to think about</li>
          <li>Web design and development: What a shock right?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Honourable Mentions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In Decemeber 2010 I was lucky enough to meet the wife of Eddie Mabo, Bonita. I helped open an Exhibiton in her honour and I remember this day as the biggest success story of my life.</li>
            <li>I once tried flying a drone and lets just say the day I brought it was the day I was $200 the poorer. <em>Not happy Jan</em></li>
